# Project Title: MBTI Personality Prediction Web App using Streamlit & Machine Learning

## Description

This is a **web-based MBTI Personality Prediction System** that utilizes **Machine Learning** techniques and **Streamlit** for the front-end interface. The system takes user inputs via a questionnaire and predicts their **MBTI (Myers-Briggs Type Indicator)** personality type based on a trained classification model.

The MBTI is a popular personality framework comprising 16 types based on preferences in four dimensions: Introversion/Extraversion, Intuition/Sensing, Thinking/Feeling, and Judging/Perceiving. This project showcases how ML models can classify users into these types based on scaled survey responses.

## Benefits of this Project

- **Practical ML Application**: Showcases the end-to-end development of an ML model for real-world data classification.
- **Streamlit Integration**: User-friendly interface that runs directly in the browser using Streamlit.
- **Custom Dataset**: Works with a synthetic dataset to mimic real MBTI test-style questions.
- **Explainable Output**: Displays prediction results and optional visualizations for better user understanding.
- **Modular Code**: Separated training logic, model saving, and app UI for better maintainability.

## Scope of Functionalities

- **Questionnaire-Based Input**: Users answer questions on a scale of 1 to 10.
- **MBTI Type Prediction**: Based on responses, the model predicts one of the 16 MBTI types.
- **Personality Descriptions**: Each prediction comes with detailed info like strengths, careers, and examples.
- **Accuracy Display**: Model training accuracy is displayed as feedback.
- **Visualizations**: Show probability distribution or personality trait graphs.

---

## Examples of Use

- **Taking the Test**: Users open the app, answer all 15 questions, and submit to see their MBTI type.
- **Understanding Yourself**: Read the provided breakdown of your personality traits and possible career matches.
- **Demo/Portfolio Use**: Can be showcased as a full-stack data science mini-project.

## Project Status

The project is functional and open for improvements. Future goals include:

- Uploading a larger real-world dataset for better training.
- Deploying it online via Streamlit Cloud or Hugging Face Spaces.
- Enhancing UI with images, animations, or personality charts.
- Adding login and quiz history tracking.
- **Adding a long-answer type quiz** in addition to the current objective questionnaire for deeper personality profiling.
- **Chatbot-based MBTI prediction** using Natural Language Processing (NLP), where users can talk to a chatbot and receive predictions based on their conversation.
